abstract: "This study compares local policies and regulations related to equity-based compensation in startups, with a specific focus on early-stage employee participation in equity ownership. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of nearly 3,300 early-stage startups across 24 countries, including the US, UK, Israel, and EU nations. Using Index Ventures' ranking system, which assesses countries' policies toward startup employee stock options, we examine the factors influencing equity-based compensation plans, including the compatibility of local legal systems with employee equity ownership. Our logistic regression analysis of startups' capitalization tables reveals significant associations between the presence of an employee equity compensation program and the friendliness of the home country towards employee stock options. Furthermore, our research highlights a learning curve and increasing sophistication in non-US jurisdictions, resulting in a higher rate of employee ownership adoption. Notably, each unit increase in the Index Ventures' Score corresponds to a 4% higher likelihood of having an equity compensation program. Additionally, firms incorporated a year later exhibit a 9% higher likelihood of granting equity compensation. This study provides insights into the critical factors influencing equity-based compensation plans and sheds light on the growing trend of employee ownership adoption, particularly outside the US."

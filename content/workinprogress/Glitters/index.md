abstract: "Venture capital-backed startups heavily rely on equity-based compensation to attract and retain talent. However, since the securities of these companies are not actively traded, it is unclear how much these grants are worth. The disclosure requirements for compensatory equity issuances by private companies under Rule 701 of the 1933 Securities Act are also extremely lax, providing almost no information that can be relied upon. As a result, legal and finance scholars have cautioned that startup employees may overestimate the value of their equity grants. In this study, we explore employees' preferences regarding equity compensation arrangements. There are many factors involved in the design of equity-based compensation arrangements, including the capital structure of the company, the type of securities offered (mostly stock options or restricted stock units), the vesting schedule, and the exercise price. Almost no research has been conducted on how these attributes impact startups' ability to recruit talent and how they interact with cash compensation. Using a novel experimental conjoint design and a cohort of startup employees, we explore the relative influence of each of these factors on the value of competing startup job offers. We consider the policy implications of our findings."

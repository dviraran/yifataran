abstract: "Israel is known as the 'start-up nation'. Israeli start-ups raise billions of venture capital dollars every year and form the lifeblood of Israel's high-tech economy. However, the ever-growing importance of start-ups in the global and Israeli economies still awaits appropriate academic attention. In Israel, as elsewhere, the corporate law literature is dedicated almost exclusively to public companies. This article takes a first step towards addressing this omission. The article (1) lists the unique characteristics of venture-backed start-ups compared to other companies, public and private listed; (2) explains how these differences are reflected in the corporate governance of start-ups; And (3) illustrates the argument by commentating on decisions by Israeli courts concerning start-up shareholder disputes. The article presents two main contributions: First, it argues that start-ups do not fit the classic principal-agent theory of corporate law, and instead, these firms achieve cooperation among diverse input providers (team production) by implementing a unique capital structure. As a result, start-ups' corporate governance requires different, and often counterintuitive, legal reasoning. Second, the article demonstrates that Israeli courts' decisions concerning start-up shareholder disputes are often inconsistent and demonstrate unfamiliarity with the characteristics of start-ups and the venture capital industry's business norms. Thus, there is a high degree of uncertainty in litigation before Israeli courts, which can encourage the adoption of arbitration and mediation clauses. This trend may generate divergence between law in books and law in action with regard to start-ups and venture capital. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the situation, including the use of court-appointed experts who possess specific expertise in venture capital finance and strengthening the legal academia in start-up law."

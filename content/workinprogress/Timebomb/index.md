abstract: "In the dynamic realm of Silicon Valley, restricted stock units (RSUs) have emerged as a ticking timebomb for employees in private tech companies. These double-trigger RSUs hold the promise of future stock shares contingent upon meeting specific vesting conditions, including continuous employment and a liquidity event. However, the prolonged period before initial public offerings (IPOs) and market uncertainties increase the risk of forfeiture for employees holding RSUs. Many grants include a provision that terminates them if a liquidity event does not occur within seven years of the grant date. This Chapter critically examines the intricate relationship between equity compensation, IPO timing, and the evolving regulatory landscape in the tech industry. It emphasizes the challenges and the complex interplay between private capital markets regulation and human capital management. Additionally, the  Chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Israeli approach to equity-based compensation, shedding light on key regulations and tax implications. The conclusion synthesizes the findings, deliberates on the implications for startups and regulators, and proposes directions for future research. By illuminating this crucial issue and presenting an alternative framework, this Chapter offers valuable insights to navigate the multifaceted realm of equity-based compensation in technology startups."

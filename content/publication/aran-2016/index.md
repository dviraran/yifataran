abstract: "This article investigates the effect of creating a specialized economic\
  \ court on subsequent litigation rates, forum selection, and court performance.\
  \ To do so, we utilized a quasi-experimental research design and compared court\
  \ decisions under two time frames: before and after the reform, and two judicial\
  \ frameworks: the specialized court vs. generalist courts. Using data from Israel,\
  \ where an Economic Division within the Tel Aviv District Court was established\
  \ in 2010, we find evidence that specialization fosters a speedy development of\
  \ a coherent and consistent body of law. This effect is driven by speedy adjudication\
  \ and by judges' relying on each otherâ€™s past decisions to jointly develop the case\
  \ law. Importantly, although increased efficiency was not exclusively related to\
  \ specialization, further analysis suggests that the specialized division is more\
  \ capable of managing a particularly time-consuming docket. Lastly, although the\
  \ reform did not lead to the initiation of a greater number of lawsuits, it did\
  \ cause a major shift in forum selection and thus the specialized division became\
  \ the center of securities litigation in Israel. The quantitative methods developed\
  \ in this research successfully provided a nuanced analysis of outcomes, providing\
  \ a model for use by other researchers. We conclude that specialization may be especially\
  \ productive in developing markets like Israel, where the use of private lawsuits\
  \ to promote investor protection is relatively new and growing rapidly. "

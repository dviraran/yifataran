Yifat is a JSD candidate and a Donna Schweers and Thomas Geiser Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow (SIGF) specializing in corporate governance and securities regulation. Her doctoral dissertation focuses on equity-based compensation for startup employees. Specifically, she studies the mechanisms through which startup employees’ dual capacity as equity holders—holding options, RSUs, or other vehicles—and as suppliers of labor, influences talent acquisition, retention, and intra-firm transparency. Her note Beyond Covenants Not To Compete: Equilibrium In High-Tech Start-Up Labor Markets (Stanford Law Review ,2018) has won the John Hart Ely Prize in Law and Economics and the Stanford Law Intellectual Property Writing Award.

Yifat holds an LLB in Law and Humanities (summa cum laude, 2010) and an LLM in Law (magna cum laude, 2013), both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She also holds a JSM in International Legal Studies from Stanford Law School (2015). During her studies, Yifat was a member of the editorial board of the Hebrew University’s major law review and served as research and teaching assistant in numerous courses. Yifat received an array of honors and awards, including a John M. Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics, an International Peace Scholarship from the P.E.O. International Sisterhood (twice), and the E. David Fischman Scholarship for most accomplished Israeli students in law, political science, and economics.

Prior her arrival at Stanford, Yifat practiced commercial and securities litigation for four years in a Jerusalem-based law firm and clerked for two recent Chief Justices of the Israeli Supreme Court (Chief Justice Dorit Beinish and Chief Justice Asher Grunis).

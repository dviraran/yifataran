Yifat is an Assistant Professor at the Law School of Haifa University, and a visiting scholar at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering & Management at the Technion - Israel Insititute for Technology. 

Yifat's scholarship examines legal conditions that facilitate early investment in high-growth technology companies and influence the distribution of the wealth these firms create. Her research places special emphasis on the relationship between venture capital and human capital and the incentive structures that mediate this interaction. Yifat graduated with a JSD from Stanford University in 2020, where she was a Donna Schweers and Thomas Geiser Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow (SIGF), and an Olin Program in Law and Economics Fellow. 

Yifat holds an LLB in Law and Humanities (summa cum laude, 2010) and an LLM in Law (magna cum laude, 2013), both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She also holds a JSM in International Legal Studies from Stanford Law School (2015). During her studies, Yifat was a member of the editorial board of the Hebrew Universityâ€™s major law review and served as a research and teaching assistant in numerous courses. Yifat received an array of honors and awards, including the John Hart Ely Prize in Law and Economics, an International Peace Scholarship from the P.E.O. International Sisterhood (twice), and the E. David Fischman Scholarship for most accomplished Israeli students in law, political science, and economics.

Prior to her arrival at Stanford, Yifat practiced commercial and securities litigation in a Jerusalem-based law firm and clerked for two former Chief Justices of the Israeli Supreme Court (Chief Justice Dorit Beinish and Chief Justice Asher Grunis).

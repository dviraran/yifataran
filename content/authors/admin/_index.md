I am an Assistant Professor at the Law School of Haifa University, and a visiting scholar at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering & Management at the Technion - Israel Institute for Technology.
  
My primary research interests lie in corporate law and governance and in securities regulation, with a focus on venture capital and the entrepreneurial process. Although corporate law literature mainly centers on public corporations and markets, an ever-growing share of the overall economic activity is carried out by private venture-capital backed firms. My scholarship responds to this long-term trend by examining the legal conditions that facilitate the growth of these companies and that influence the distribution of the wealth these companies create. My work specifically emphasizes the relationship between venture capital and human capital and reconceptualizes the boundaries between corporate and securities law, on one hand, and labor law, on the other.
 
My approach offers a new dimension in the securities regulation debate, as it seeks to integrate labor market considerations with the capital market considerations that have traditionally guided the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Thus, it proposes broader efficiency-based insights that cannot be derived from the traditional exclusive focus on capital market efficiency. Such a paradigm shift is warranted due to two long term trends: the widespread and growing use of equity-based compensation has transformed high-skilled labor from a pure labor relationship into one that involves a significant investment component, and; highly skilled human capital is rapidly replacing financial capital as the limiting factor in economic development and technological progress. Facilitating an efficient allocation of talent, alongside efficient allocation of financial capital, is therefore a worthy goal for the securities regulatory regime, which requires a reconceptualization of underlying theory and practice.
